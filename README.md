# NetPwn

NetPwn is a Python script that simulates hacking activities in a fictional environment. 
It allows players to perform various hacking tasks, attack networks, exploit vulnerabilities, and upgrade their hacking abilities.

## Features

- **Network Simulation**: Simulates networks with different security levels, IP addresses, and bank balances.
- **Hacking Tasks**: Players can perform hacking tasks such as reconnaissance, phishing attacks, port scanning, and more.
- **Exploits**: Choose from a variety of exploits to use against hacked networks, including worms, viruses, and botnets.
- **Upgrades**: Purchase upgrades to enhance hacking abilities, such as worm, virus, botnet, and tool upgrades.
- **Player Stats**: View statistics about the player's performance, including wallet balance, total money stolen, total hacks, total exploits used, and botnet size.
- **Exiting Sequence**: Simulates shutting down operations with progress bars for each exiting task.

## Customization

You can customize the script by adding new hacking tasks, exploits, upgrades, or exiting tasks. Additionally, you can modify existing features to enhance gameplay or add new functionalities.

## Notes

I built this project as a fun side project and to deepen my coding skills. It's essentially a game where you play as a hacker, infiltrating computer networks. You get to pick which networks to target, and once you breach one, you can perform actions like stealing money or expanding your reach to more devices. There's even a feature where you can create a network of hacked computers to speed up your hacking efforts. Although I didn't finish everything I set out to do with this project, it was a valuable learning experience. There are some unfinished parts and unused code remnants, mainly because I revamped the entire codebase during development.
